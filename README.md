## Add Free News

This is a project for personal use. There are lots of adds in news websites. I developed a project to follow different sources of news without any adds. I scrape the data with nodejs when a request is made to the front-end server that's why the response speed is not ideal but considering the simple interface without any adds and the number of news sources I might say it is very usefull. 

### Note: Since I am getting the data with web scraping it is quite possible that now or somewhere in the future some sources to stop working due to the changement of html classes.
